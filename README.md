# mupen64ini2dat

This program was used to convert Mupen64 ROM information and settings from ini
format to a sorted structure format. By using this program, the size of the
Mupen64 executable was reduced by approximately 500 KiB, and the time required
to find ROM information from the data was less due to the use of binary search.

See [here](https://github.com/deltabeard/mini64-libretro#ROMSI) for more
information.

This program was made for my libretro fork of Mupen64,
[Mini64](https://github.com/deltabeard/mini64-libretro).
